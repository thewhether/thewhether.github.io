I'm making a new blog post. Last class was a bit of a mind fug. The JS writing is probably my biggest issue. I think it also still takes me a bit longer to process a lot of the logic that goes into the creation of JS solutions. The writing of the code is also really tedious. It's something that I think I can get better at with practice, but finding reasons to practice may prove difficult.

With CSS, I know I can nail things with a bit more practice. I'm looking forward to learning a bit more about Sass. It looks like a huge time-saver. Same for the Responsive Mobile First approach to progressive CSS habits.
